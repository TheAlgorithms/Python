🧩**Usage Example**

This repository contains implementations of many popular algorithms and data structures in Python.
You can clone the repository, explore, run tests, and even add your own algorithms easily.

🛠️**Clone the Repository**
# Clone the repo
git clone https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python.git

# Move into the folder
cd Python

🧪**Run Tests**
You can use the built-in Python test framework to verify that all algorithms work correctly.
# Run all tests
python -m unittest discover

# Or run a specific test file
python -m unittest tests/test_sorting.py

💡 Tip: Always make sure your Python version matches the one mentioned in the repository’s requirements (usually Python 3.10+).

🧠**Try Out an Algorithm**
You can run any algorithm file directly to understand how it works.
For example, let’s run the Bubble Sort algorithm:

# Navigate to the sorting folder
cd sorting

# Run bubble_sort.py
python bubble_sort.py

Output Example:
Unsorted array: [5, 1, 4, 2, 8]
Sorted array:   [1, 2, 4, 5, 8]

✍️ Add Your Own Algorithm
You can contribute by adding new algorithms or improving existing ones.
1.Fork the repository
2.Create a new branch for your feature(#most important thing to do)

# ----> git checkout -b add-new-algorithm <----

3.Add your code inside the appropriate directory (e.g. graphs/, sorting/, etc.)
4.Include:
Proper function docstrings

5.Example usage
1.Time and space complexity comments
2.Test your code and submit a Pull Request 🚀

📦**Example Output (from Dijkstra’s Algorithm)**
# python graphs/dijkstra.py
Sample Output
# Shortest distances from source:
A: 0
B: 4
C: 2
D: 7

🧾 **Commit and Create a Pull Request**
Once you’ve verified everything works:

# git add .
# git commit -m "Added new algorithm: My Algorithm"
# git push origin add-new-algorithm

# Then, open your fork on GitHub and click “**Compare & pull request**”.
Be sure to:
1.Write a clear PR title and description
2.Explain what your code does and where it fits
3.Add example input/output and complexity if possible

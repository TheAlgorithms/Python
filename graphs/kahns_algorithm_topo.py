def topological_sort(graph: dict[int, list[int]]) -> list[int] | None:
    """
    Perform topological sorting of a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)
    using Kahn's Algorithm via Breadth-First Search (BFS).

    Topological sorting is a linear ordering of vertices in a graph such that for
    every directed edge u â†’ v, vertex u comes before vertex v in the ordering.

    Parameters:
    graph: Adjacency list representing the directed graph where keys are
           vertices, and values are lists of adjacent vertices.

    Returns:
    The topologically sorted order of vertices if the graph is a DAG.
    Returns None if the graph contains a cycle.

    Example:
    >>> graph = {0: [1, 2], 1: [3], 2: [3], 3: [4, 5], 4: [], 5: []}
    >>> topological_sort(graph)
    [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

    >>> graph_with_cycle = {0: [1], 1: [2], 2: [0]}
    >>> topological_sort(graph_with_cycle)

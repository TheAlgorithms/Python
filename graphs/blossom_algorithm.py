"""
Blossom Algorithm (Edmonds' Algorithm) for Maximum Matching in General Graphs.

The Blossom algorithm finds a maximum cardinality matching in any undirected graph.
It was developed by Jack Edmonds in 1965 and is one of the most important algorithms
in combinatorial optimization.

This implementation provides a simplified but working version that handles
maximum matching correctly for many practical cases.

Time Complexity: O(V * E) for this simplified implementation
Space Complexity: O(V + E)

    Simplified implementation of Edmonds' Blossom Algorithm for maximum matching.

    This implementation uses a greedy approach that works correctly for maximum
    matching in many practical cases, though it may not handle all complex
    blossom contractions optimally.

    Example:
    >>> # Single edge graph
    >>> graph = [[1], [0]]
    >>> blossom = BlossomAlgorithm(graph)
    >>> matching = blossom.maximum_matching()
    >>> len(matching) // 2

    >>> empty_graph = [[] for _ in range(3)]
    >>> blossom_empty = BlossomAlgorithm(empty_graph)
    >>> len(blossom_empty.maximum_matching())
    0

    >>> # Triangle graph (requires blossom handling)
    >>> triangle = [[1, 2], [0, 2], [0, 1]]
    >>> blossom_triangle = BlossomAlgorithm(triangle)
    >>> matching_triangle = blossom_triangle.maximum_matching()
    >>> len(matching_triangle) // 2  # Should match 1 edge

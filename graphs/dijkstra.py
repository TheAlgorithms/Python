10 -   for each neighbor V and edge cost c of U in G:

12 -       continue to next neighbor V in line 10

14 -     if total_cost is less than costs.get(V, âˆž):
15 -       update costs[V] to total_cost

// At the end, if destination d is not reachable, return -1

You can think at cost as a distance where Dijkstra finds the shortest distance
between vertices s and v in a graph G. The use of a min heap as H guarantees
that if a vertex has already been explored there will be no other path with
shortest distance, that happens because heapq.heappop will always return the
next vertex with the shortest distance, considering that the heap stores not
only the distance between previous vertex and current vertex but the entire
distance between each vertex that makes up the path from start vertex to target
vertex.

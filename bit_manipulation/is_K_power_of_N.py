The error message `Syntax Error @ 1:1. tokenizer error: '`' is not a valid character in this position\` indicates that the Python parser is encountering an invalid character right at the beginning of the file.

The character causing the issue is the backtick symbol (`` ` ``) which seems to have been included at the very start of the code block. This is not a valid character to start a Python statement.

Here is the corrected code. It is identical to the previous version, but without the leading backtick, making it syntactically correct.

Task:
Given two positive integers, n and k, determine if k is a power of n.

Implementation notes: Use a loop to repeatedly divide k by n.
For a number k to be a power of n, it must be possible to reduce k
to 1 by repeatedly dividing by n without any remainder.
For example, 8 is a power of 2 because:
8 / 2 = 4
4 / 2 = 2
2 / 2 = 1
The final result is 1.

# This Python program implements an optimal binary search tree (abbreviated BST)
# building dynamic programming algorithm that delivers O(n^2) performance.
#
# The goal of the optimal BST problem is to build a low-cost BST for a
# given set of nodes, each with its own key and frequency. The frequency
# of the node is defined as how many time the node is being searched.
# The search cost of binary search tree is given by this formula:
#
# cost(1, n) = sum{i = 1 to n}((depth(node_i) + 1) * node_i_freq)
#
# where n is number of nodes in the BST. The characteristic of low-cost
# BSTs is having a faster overall search time than other implementations.
# The reason for their fast search time is that the nodes with high
# frequencies will be placed near the root of the tree while the nodes
# with low frequencies will be placed near the leaves of the tree thus
# reducing search time in the most frequent instances.

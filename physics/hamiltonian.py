"""
Functions to calculate the Hamiltonian in both classical and quantum mechanics.

Overview:
    The Hamiltonian represents the total energy of a system.

    - In classical mechanics, it is the sum of kinetic and potential energies.

    - In quantum mechanics, it becomes an operator acting on the wavefunction ψ(x), describing how the system evolves in time.

This module includes:
    - classical_hamiltonian(): return total energy for given mass, momentum, and potential.
    - quantum_hamiltonian_1d(): Builds a 1D Hamiltonian matrix for numerical quantum systems.

    Construct the 1-D quantum Hamiltonian matrix for a particle in given potential.

    Description:
        In quantum mechanics, the Hamiltonian (H) represents the total energy
        of a particle, combining both kinetic and potential energy components.
        For a particle of mass m in one spatial dimension, it is defined as:

            H = - (ħ² / 2m) * (d²/dx²) + V(x)

            - The first term is the kinetic energy operator.
            - The second term is the potential energy V(x).

        Using the *finite difference method*, the second derivative is approximated by:
            d²ψ/dx² ≈ (ψ[i+1] - 2ψ[i] + ψ[i-1]) / (Δx²)

        This turns the continuous operator into a discrete matrix.

    Formula:
        H[i, i]   = (ħ² / (m × Δx²)) + V[i]
        H[i, i±1] = - (ħ² / (2m × Δx²))

    Parameters:
        mass (float): Mass of the particle. (must be positive)
        hbar (float): Reduced Planck constant. (must be positive)
        potential_energy_array (np.ndarray): Potential energy values V(x) at each grid point.
        grid_spacing (float): Distance between consecutive grid points Δx. (must be positive)
        round_to (int | None): Number of decimal places to round the matrix to.
                               If None (default), no rounding is applied.

    Returns:
        np.ndarray: The discrete Hamiltonian matrix representing the total energy operator.

    Examples:
        >>> import numpy as np
        >>> potential = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0])

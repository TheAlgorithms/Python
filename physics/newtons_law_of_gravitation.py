Title : Finding the value of either Gravitational Force, one of the masses or distance
provided that the other three parameters are given.

Description : Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation explains the presence of force of
attraction between bodies having a definite mass situated at a distance. It is usually
stated as that, every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a
force that is directly proportional to the product of their masses and inversely
proportional to the square of the distance between their centers. The publication of the
theory has become known as the "first great unification", as it marked the unification
of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical
behaviors.

The equation for the universal gravitation is as follows:
F = (G * mass_1 * mass_2) / (distance)^2

"""
This function builds a Directed Acyclic Graph representation of the Knapsack problem.
This allows us to solve knapsack-style problems with Shortest Path algorithms.
See https://github.com/Matti02co/graph-based-scheduling for more details.

The graph consists of n+2 layers:
- Layer 0 contains the source node 's'.
- Layer n+1 contains the sink node 't'.
- Intermediate layers (1..n) correspond to the n items.

Each intermediate layer j has (capacity + 1) nodes: j0, j1, ..., jC,
where jk represents the state of having considered the first j items
with a total weight of k so far.

From each node jk there are at most two outgoing edges:
- Skip item j+1 (weight and cost remain the same).
- Take item j+1 (only if total weight + item's weight â‰¤ capacity), with a cost
  equal to the negative of the item's value (we solve via shortest path).

All nodes in the last layer are connected to 't' with zero-cost edges.

In this representation, every path from 's' to 't' corresponds to a feasible
Knapsack solution, and the shortest path (negative costs) corresponds to
the maximum total value selection.

"""
In the Combination Sum problem, we are given a list consisting of distinct integers.
We need to find all the combinations whose sum equals to target given.
We can use an element more than one.

Time complexity(Average Case): O(n!)

Constraints:
1 <= candidates.length <= 30
2 <= candidates[i] <= 40
All elements of candidates are distinct.
1 <= target <= 40

    A recursive function that searches for possible combinations. Backtracks in case

++       Cell c0 = 2
> +++++  Cell c1 = 5

[        Start your loops with your cell pointer on the loop counter (c1 in our case)
< +      Add 1 to c0
> -      Subtract 1 from c1
]        End your loops with the cell pointer on the loop counter

At this point our program has added 5 to 2 leaving 7 in c0 and 0 in c1
but we cannot output this value to the terminal since it is not ASCII encoded

To display the ASCII character "7" we must add 48 to the value 7
We use a loop to compute 48 = 6 * 8

++++ ++++  c1 = 8 and this will be our loop counter again
[
< +++ +++  Add 6 to c0
> -        Subtract 1 from c1
]
< .        Print out c0 which has the value 55 which translates to "7"!

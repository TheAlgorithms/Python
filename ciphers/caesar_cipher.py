    =======

    Encodes a given string with the caesar cipher and returns the encoded
    message

    Parameters:
    -----------

    *   `input_string`: the plain-text that needs to be encoded
    *   `key`: the number of letters to shift the message by

    Optional:

    *   `alphabet` (``None``): the alphabet used to encode the cipher, if not
        specified, the standard english alphabet with upper and lowercase
        letters is used

    Returns:

    *   A string containing the encoded cipher-text

    More on the caesar cipher
    =========================

    The caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar who used it when sending
    secret military messages to his troops. This is a simple substitution cipher
    where every character in the plain-text is shifted by a certain number known
    as the "key" or "shift".

    Example:
    Say we have the following message:
    ``Hello, captain``

    And our alphabet is made up of lower and uppercase letters:
    ``abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ``

    And our shift is ``2``

    We can then encode the message, one letter at a time. ``H`` would become ``J``,
    since ``J`` is two letters away, and so on. If the shift is ever two large, or
    our letter is at the end of the alphabet, we just start at the beginning
    (``Z`` would shift to ``a`` then ``b`` and so on).

    Our final message would be ``Jgnnq, ecrvckp``

    =======

    Decodes a given string of cipher-text and returns the decoded plain-text

    Parameters:
    -----------

    *   `input_string`: the cipher-text that needs to be decoded
    *   `key`: the number of letters to shift the message backwards by to decode

    Optional:

    *   `alphabet` (``None``): the alphabet used to decode the cipher, if not

        letters is used

    Returns:

    *   A string containing the decoded plain-text

    More on the caesar cipher
    =========================

    The caesar cipher is named after Julius Caesar who used it when sending
    secret military messages to his troops. This is a simple substitution cipher
    where very character in the plain-text is shifted by a certain number known
    as the "key" or "shift". Please keep in mind, here we will be focused on
    decryption.

    Example:
    Say we have the following cipher-text:
    ``Jgnnq, ecrvckp``

    And our alphabet is made up of lower and uppercase letters:
    ``abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyzABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ``

    And our shift is ``2``

    To decode the message, we would do the same thing as encoding, but in
    reverse. The first letter, ``J`` would become ``H`` (remember: we are decoding)
    because ``H`` is two letters in reverse (to the left) of ``J``. We would
    continue doing this. A letter like ``a`` would shift back to the end of
    the alphabet, and would become ``Z`` or ``Y`` and so on.

    Our final message would be ``Hello, captain``

    brute_force
    ===========

    Returns all the possible combinations of keys and the decoded strings in the
    form of a dictionary

    Parameters:
    -----------

    *   `input_string`: the cipher-text that needs to be used during brute-force

    Optional:

    *   `alphabet` (``None``): the alphabet used to decode the cipher, if not
        specified, the standard english alphabet with upper and lowercase
        letters is used

    More about brute force
    ======================

    Brute force is when a person intercepts a message or password, not knowing
    the key and tries every single combination. This is easy with the caesar
    cipher since there are only all the letters in the alphabet. The more
    complex the cipher, the larger amount of time it will take to do brute force

    Ex:
    Say we have a ``5`` letter alphabet (``abcde``), for simplicity and we intercepted
    the following message: ``dbc``,
    we could then just write out every combination:
    ``ecd``... and so on, until we reach a combination that makes sense:
    ``cab``

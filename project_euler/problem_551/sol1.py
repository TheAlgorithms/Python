Sum of digits sequence
Problem 551

Let a(0), a(1),... be an integer sequence defined by:
     a(0) = 1
     for n >= 1, a(n) is the sum of the digits of all preceding terms

The sequence starts with 1, 1, 2, 4, 8, ...
You are given a(10^6) = 31054319.

Find a(10^15)

    Calculates and updates a_i in-place to either the n-th term or the
    smallest term for which c > 10^k when the terms are written in the form:
            a(i) = b * 10^k + c

    For any a(i), if digitsum(b) and c have the same value, the difference
    between subsequent terms will be the same until c >= 10^k.  This difference
    is cached to greatly speed up the computation.

           the i-th term in the sequence

          Term are calulcated until c > 10^k or the n-th term is reached.
    i -- position along the sequence
    n -- term to calculate up to if k is large enough

    Return: a tuple of difference between ending term and starting term, and
    the number of terms calculated. ex. if starting term is a_0=1, and
    ending term is a_10=62, then (61, 9) is returned.

# Divide and Conquer Algorithms Folder

This folder contains implementations of **Divide and Conquer algorithms**, which solve problems by:

1. Dividing the problem into smaller subproblems
2. Solving each subproblem recursively
3. Combining the results to get the final solution

To ensure high-quality contributions, each algorithm should follow the guidelines in `CONTRIBUTING.md`:

- Recursive divide-and-conquer logic
- Descriptive function and class names
- Unit tests demonstrating correctness
- Type hints for all functions
- Clear code organization


### Notes for Contributors

- Focus on **divide-and-conquer implementation**
- Include **unit tests** for typical and edge cases
- Keep **functions and classes well-named and typed**
- Maintain **folder structure and file naming consistency**

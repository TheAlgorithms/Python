# Computer Vision
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field focused on enabling computers to gain high-level understanding from images and video—automatically extracting, analyzing, and interpreting visual information to produce outputs such as labels, measurements, 3D structure, or decisions.

​

In practice, computer vision methods combine geometry, physics, statistics, and machine learning to connect pixel data to semantic concepts like objects, actions, and scenes.

​

## Image processing vs. computer vision

Image processing primarily transforms images (e.g., denoising, contrast enhancement, geometric warping) where the output is another image.

​

Computer vision uses images/video as input but often outputs information about the scene (e.g., detections, segmentation masks, pose estimates, tracking results, or a decision), which may then drive downstream behavior in a larger system.

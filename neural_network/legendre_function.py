——→ Introduction to Pytorch Autograd (TORCH.AUTOGRAD) :- 

>>> [torch.autograd] is Pytorch's automatic differential engine that powers neural network training.

—→ Background :- 

>>> Neural network (NN's) are a collection of nested function that are executed on some input data.
    These functions are defined by parameters (consist of weights & biases).

        Training a NN happens in two steps:

        → Forward Propagation :- In forward prop, NN makes its best guess about the correct output.
                                It runs the input data through each of its functions to make this guess.

        → Backward Propagation :- In backward, NN adjusts its parameters proportionate to the error in its guess.
                                  It does this by traveling backwards from the input, collecting derivative of the
                                  error with respect to the parameters of the functions(gradients), and optimizing
                                  the parameters using gradient descent.

——→ Defining New Autograd Functions

>>> In this example we define our own model as y = a + b * P₃(c + dx) instead of y = a + b*x + c*x² + d*x³, where 
    P₃(x) = (1/2)*(5*x³ - 3*x) is the legendre polynomial of degree three.

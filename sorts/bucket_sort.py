Illustrate how to implement bucket sort algorithm.

Author: OMKAR PATHAK
This program will illustrate how to implement bucket sort algorithm

Wikipedia says: Bucket sort, or bin sort, is a sorting algorithm that works
by distributing the elements of an array into a number of buckets.
Each bucket is then sorted individually, either using a different sorting
algorithm, or by recursively applying the bucket sorting algorithm. It is a
distribution sort, and is a cousin of radix sort in the most to least
significant digit flavour.
Bucket sort is a generalization of pigeonhole sort. Bucket sort can be
implemented with comparisons and therefore can also be considered a
comparison sort algorithm. The computational complexity estimates involve the
number of buckets.

Time Complexity of Solution:
Worst case scenario occurs when all the elements are placed in a single bucket.
The overall performance would then be dominated by the algorithm used to sort each
bucket. In this case, O(n log n), because of TimSort

Average Case O(n + (n^2)/k + k), where k is the number of buckets

If k = O(n), time complexity is O(n)

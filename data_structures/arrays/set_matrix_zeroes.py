Set Matrix Zeroes Algorithm
---------------------------
If an element in an m x n matrix is 0, set its entire row and column to 0.

Explanation:
We use the first row and first column as markers to track which rows and
columns should be zeroed, avoiding extra space usage (O(1) space complexity).

Doctest:
>>> matrix = [
...     [1, 1, 1],
...     [1, 0, 1],
...     [1, 1, 1]
... ]
>>> set_matrix_zeroes(matrix)
>>> matrix
[[1, 0, 1], [0, 0, 0], [1, 0, 1]]

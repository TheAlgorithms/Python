# Problem 6
## Sum square difference
The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is,

1^(2) + 2^(2) + ... + 10^(2) = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is,

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^(2) = 55^(2) = 3025

Hence the difference between the sum of the squares of the first ten natural
numbers and the square of the sum is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred
natural numbers and the square of the sum.

    Return the minimum time to reach the bottom right square of the grid from the top left,
    where time t allows swimming to cells with elevation <= t.

    This is a variant of Dijkstra's shortest path algorithm using a priority queue (min-heap)
    to find the minimum elevation (time) path in a grid graph.

    :param grid: n x n integer matrix where grid[i][j] is the elevation at (i, j)
    :return: Minimum time to reach (n-1, n-1) from (0, 0)

    Examples:
    >>> swim_in_rising_water([[0, 2], [1, 3]])

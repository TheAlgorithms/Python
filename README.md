## üéØ Project Goals

This repository is an invaluable resource for:

- **Students:** To see working examples of algorithms learned in class.
- **Developers:** To quickly reference or refresh knowledge on a specific implementation.
- **Interview Preparation:** To practice and understand the underlying logic of common interview problems.

**Our Core Philosophy:** **Clarity over Performance.** _Implementations prioritize readability and educational value. They are not optimized for production-grade speed._

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started: Your First Run

### Prerequisites

- Python **3.8+**
- (Optional but Recommended) A Python virtual environment.

### Installation

Clone the repository and install necessary dependencies:

```bash
# 1. Clone the repository
git clone [https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python.git](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python.git)
cd Python

# 2. Install dependencies (We recommend 'uv' for speed)
# pip install uv
# uv sync

# OR using pip
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running an Example
Algorithms are designed to be run directly for testing. Many include doctests for built-in verification.

Bash

# Example: Running the Fibonacci sequence algorithm
python maths/fibonacci_sequence.py

# Example: Running a Graph algorithm
python graphs/depth_first_search.py
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer
The code in this repository is designed for education and demonstration. While functionally correct, it is often written to be maximally clear rather than maximally fast.

Do not use this code in a high-performance or production environment. For optimal performance in a production setting, rely on the optimized functions within Python's Standard Library or well-established third-party libraries.

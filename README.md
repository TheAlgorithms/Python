## ÔøΩ About

This repository contains Python implementations of various algorithms and data structures for educational purposes. Whether you're a student learning algorithms, a developer preparing for technical interviews, or someone interested in computer science fundamentals, this collection provides clear and well-documented examples.

## ‚ú® Features

This repository includes implementations of algorithms across multiple categories:

- **Sorting Algorithms**: Bubble sort, Quick sort, Merge sort, Heap sort, and more
- **Searching Algorithms**: Binary search, Linear search, Jump search, Interpolation search
- **Data Structures**: Linked lists, Stacks, Queues, Trees, Graphs, Hash tables
- **Graph Algorithms**: BFS, DFS, Dijkstra's algorithm, Floyd-Warshall, Bellman-Ford
- **Dynamic Programming**: Knapsack, Longest Common Subsequence, Edit Distance
- **Machine Learning**: Neural networks, Linear regression, K-means clustering
- **Mathematical Algorithms**: Prime number algorithms, GCD, LCM, Number theory
- **String Algorithms**: Pattern matching, String manipulation, Parsing
- **Cryptography**: Various cipher implementations
- **Computer Vision**: Image processing algorithms
- **And many more!**

All implementations include:
- Clear documentation and explanations
- Type hints for better code readability
- Doctests for validation
- Educational comments

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python.git
   cd Python
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment (recommended)**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   
   # On Windows
   venv\Scripts\activate
   
   # On macOS/Linux
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Usage

Each algorithm is self-contained in its own file. You can run any algorithm directly or import it into your own projects.

**Example 1: Running an algorithm directly**
```bash
python sorts/quick_sort.py
```

**Example 2: Importing and using an algorithm**
```python
from sorts.quick_sort import quick_sort

# Sort a list
numbers = [64, 34, 25, 12, 22, 11, 90]
sorted_numbers = quick_sort(numbers)
print(sorted_numbers)  # Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 34, 64, 90]
```

**Example 3: Running doctests**
```bash
python -m doctest -v sorts/bubble_sort.py
```

## 🧠 About the Project

**The Algorithms – Python** is a learning-focused repository containing a variety of algorithms, data structures, and problem-solving approaches written in Python.
It’s a community effort to make algorithm learning more approachable and hands-on.

💡 Whether you’re a **beginner exploring your first pull request** or an **experienced developer refining your craft**, this project welcomes you!

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Read the [**Contribution Guidelines**](CONTRIBUTING.md) — they’ll help you set up your local environment and understand our workflow.
2. Pick an algorithm idea you’d like to implement or improve.
3. Submit your pull request — every contribution matters, no matter how small.

> 🏆 **Tip:** Even fixing typos or improving documentation helps the project — and it counts toward open-source experience!

---

## 🤝 How to Contribute

We believe everyone can contribute — here’s how you can get involved:

- 🧩 **Add a new algorithm or data structure**
- 🧠 **Optimize or refactor** an existing one
- 🧾 **Improve documentation** or code comments
- 🧪 **Add test cases** to increase reliability
- 🎨 **Enhance visuals or examples** for better understanding

Check the [Issues tab](https://github.com/TheAlgorithms/Python/issues) — some are tagged with `good first issue` and are great starting points!

<!-- Short description: -->
  <h3>All algorithms implemented in Python - for education 📚</h3>
</div>

Implementations are for learning purposes only. They may be less efficient than the implementations in the Python standard library. Use them at your discretion.

## 🚀 Getting Started

📋 Read through our [Contribution Guidelines](CONTRIBUTING.md) before you contribute.

## 🌐 Community Channels

We are on [Discord](https://the-algorithms.com/discord) and [Gitter](https://gitter.im/TheAlgorithms/community)! Community channels are a great way for you to ask questions and get help. Please join us!

## 📜 List of Algorithms

See our [directory](DIRECTORY.md) for easier navigation and a better overview of the project.

## 🤝 Contributing

We welcome contributions from the community!
Whether you’re fixing a typo, improving documentation, or adding new algorithms, every contribution is valuable.

Before contributing, please make sure to:

1. Read our full [Contributing Guidelines](./CONTRIBUTING.md).
2. Ensure your code follows our style guide:
   - Python 3.13+ compatible
   - Uses descriptive variable and function names
   - Includes type hints and docstrings with doctests
3. Run the following tools locally before submitting a pull request:
   ```bash
   # Format your code
   black .

   # Lint and style checks
   ruff check

   # Run doctests
   python3 -m doctest -v your_file.py

   # Run mypy type checking
   mypy --ignore-missing-imports .
   ```
4. Make sure your pull request is original and not a duplicate implementation.

If you want to fix an existing issue, just open a PR. there’s no need to ask for assignment.
For new algorithms, please go straight to submitting a pull request rather than opening an issue.

For more details, check the full [Contributing Guide](./CONTRIBUTING.md).

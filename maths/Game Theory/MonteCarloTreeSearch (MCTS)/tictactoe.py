"""
An example implementation of the abstract Node class for use in MCTS

If you run this file then you can play against the computer.

A tic-tac-toe board is represented as a tuple of 9 values, each either None,
True, or False, respectively meaning 'empty', 'X', and 'O'.

The board is indexed by row:
0 1 2
3 4 5
6 7 8

For example, this game board
O - X
O X -
X - -
corrresponds to this tuple:
(False, None, True, False, True, None, True, None, None)

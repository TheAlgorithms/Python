"""
The Mandelbrot set is the set of complex numbers "c" for which the series
"z_(n+1) = z_n * z_n + c" does not diverge, i.e. remains bounded. Thus, a
complex number "c" is a member of the Mandelbrot set if, when starting with
"z_0 = 0" and applying the iteration repeatedly, the absolute value of
"z_n" remains bounded for all "n > 0". Complex numbers can be written as
"a + b*i": "a" is the real component, usually drawn on the x-axis, and "b*i"
is the imaginary component, usually drawn on the y-axis. Most visualizations
of the Mandelbrot set use a color-coding to indicate after how many steps in
the series the numbers outside the set diverge. Images of the Mandelbrot set
exhibit an elaborate and infinitely complicated boundary that reveals
progressively ever-finer recursive detail at increasing magnifications, making
the boundary of the Mandelbrot set a fractal curve.
